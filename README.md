# What is this mod?
Just a PC-port of GOOMPS by RedBrumbler. [Quest version.](https://github.com/RedBrumbler/GOOMPS)

GetOutOfMyPersonalSpace (GOOMPS) is a mod that will make monkeys that get too close be invisible, forcing them to respect your personal space!

Hides monkeys that get too close. Does not hide name tag or particles, so you can still somewhat see the monkeys (for tagging purposes).

## Manual Installation
Be sure that you are already installed BepInEx (using MonkeModManager for example). You need x64 version. [Take it there.](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)

If your BepInEx copy installed then copy-paste GOOMPS.dll to your Gorilla Tag/BepInEx/plugins folder somewhere (Gorilla Tag/BepInEx/GOOMPS/GOOMPS.dll for example).

## Config

You can found a config at this path: `Gorilla Tag/BepInEx/config/GOOMPS.cfg`

Just open it and you'll see everything you need.
